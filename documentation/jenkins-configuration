Start dockerized jenkins:

    docker run --name jenkins1 -p 8080:8080 -p 50000:50000 jenkins/jenkins:lts

in the logs you'll see a complicated-looking alphanumeric string, that's the
initial admin password

From here on we assume JENKINS_URL is at http://localhost:8080

    export JENKINS_URL=http://localhost:8080

Go to JENKINS_URL, enter admin password, select the predefined plugins set,
wait for installation to complete.

Setup your first (and only) job:

* Create a "Freestyle project"
* Name: "Useless Job" (without quotes)
* GitHub project/ Project URL: https://github.com/icassina/useless.git
* setup SCM: git
** url: https://github.com:icassina/useless.git
** branch: */master
** username & password credentials
*** username: your github username
*** password: your github personal access token
* Build
** Execute shell: ./sbt.sh -no-colors package
** Execute shell: ./sbt.sh -no-colors test
* Post-build Actions
** Publish JUnit test result report: target/test-reports/TEST-*.xml
* SAVE

now you can click "Build now"

test results will be found here:

    curl -u xlr-facet:xlr-facet "$JENKINS_URL/job/Useless%20Job/1/testReport/api/json?pretty=true

In general the "1" in that url corresponds to the build number. Since our plan
is to fetch information about a KNOWN build, that would be one of our
parameters. Otherwise we could query jenkins api to give us the number of
lastBuild (including yet-to-be-finished), lastFailed build, lastCompletedBuild
or lastSuccessfulBuild.
